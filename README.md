# Movie-Recommendation-System

Developed a highly accurate and efficient movie recommendation
system utilizing Machine Learning algorithms and Data Analysis
techniques.  

The system utilizes a large database of movie metadata, including user
ratings, movie genres, and production details, to deliver highly
personalized and relevant suggestions.  

Used the Cosine Similarity algorithm to find similarities among all other
movies.  

The system uses content-based filtering to
suggest movies tailored to each userâ€™s unique preferences.
